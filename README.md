#Pique
###Intelligent Social Media aggregation

Pique is an automated engine for gathering, sorting, and displaying trending web content.
It is designed to streamline content consumption, allowing users to access top and trending content from multiple social media platforms quickly.

Pique is built on the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/), and leverages [Redis](redis.io) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for incredibly fast data access.

Check out how pique was designed and built in our [Wiki!](https://github.com/edolinsky/pique/wiki)
